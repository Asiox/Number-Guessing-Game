# Number-Guessing-Game
Coded in C++ programming language utilizing Visual Studio 2022 C++ IDE. 
The application will let the user choose how many guesses to make-a minimum and a maximum number. After the user enters a number within that range, the application lets them estimate what it is. They win if they make the amount of predictions they indicated at the beginning 
Unsure with how many iterations would be needed, I used a while loop for the primary application loop. The code was then executed a certain number of times using a for loop, and if/else statements were used to verify user input and take appropriate action.
